# Instructions on how to run the code

***Remark: Figure(1) is commented out since it is time-consuming within the loop to draw the structure repeatedly***

## Problem1.m
1. For Q1 and Q2, please run the code directly. Figure (2)-(4) will answer the questions.
2. For Q3, please change the radii of R1 and R2 to 0.025 (**Line 16 & 18**). Figure (2) will answer the questions.
3. For Q4, please change _method_ (**Line 88 & 89**) and _dt_ (**Line 93 & 95**) accrodingly. Figure(5) will answer the questions.

## Problem2.m
1. For Q1 and Q2, please run the code directly. Figure (2)-(3) will answer the questions.
2. For Q3, please change _dt_ (**Line 26**) and _N_ (**Line 30**) respectively for temporal and spatial discretization to collect data. Figure (4) will answer the questions.
  
## Problem3.m
1. For Q1, please run the code directly. Figure (2) will answer the questions.
2. For Q2, please change the loop condition to `1:length(PP0)` (**Line 57**) to collect data with different forces. Figure (3) will answer the questions.
